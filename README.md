# TON-Sign
## By \~Emerald~
**TON-Sign** is a cool lil app I made for the VRChat game *Terrors of Nowhere*. This asset uses OSC to display the next round type beside the start button, meaning you should never miss another Alternate round again!

## Setup Instructions

Setting up the TON Sign on your avatar is quick and easy:

1. **Drag the "TON Constraint" Prefab** onto your Avatar's Root.
   - This should be at the same hierarchy level as "Body," "Armature," or similar objects.
2. **‚ú® VRCFury Magic ‚ú®**
   - VRCFury will automatically add the required toggle to your avatar during the upload process. No manual adjustments needed!

### Usage Notes

- **Processing Time: (IMPROVED IN NEW VERSION)** 
  - The app may need to process up to 2 rounds to accurately determine your lobby's round order!
  - On a completely fresh lobby, this may be slightly longer due to "level of suffering" but it should correct itself fast!
  
- **Existing Lobby:** 
  - If you‚Äôve already been in the lobby for a short while before launching the app, it should automatically detect the round order without needing to process any new rounds. Just start the app and toggle the sign!

### Running the App

1. **Launch** `TONSign_Classic_or_SpecialV2.2.exe` OR `TONSign_JP_V2.2.exe` for JP!
2. **Start some rounds in Terrors of Nowhere.** 
   - The app will handle the rest!

The app also prints out some useful debug info, such as if it detects a host-change. It also shows the types of up to the last 7 rounds.
