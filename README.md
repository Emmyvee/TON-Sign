# TON-Sign

**TON-Sign** is a cool lil app I made for the VRChat game *Terrors of Nowhere*. This asset uses OSC to display the next round type beside the start button, meaning you should never miss another Alternate round again!

### ðŸš¨ Important Notice ðŸš¨
**This asset uses VRCFury for automatic setup. Please ensure the latest version of VRCFury is installed in your Unity project.**

## Setup Instructions

Setting up the TON Sign on your avatar is quick and easy:

1. **Drag the "TON Constraint" Prefab** onto your Avatar's Root.
   - This should be at the same hierarchy level as "Body," "Armature," or similar objects.
2. **âœ¨ VRCFury Magic âœ¨**
   - VRCFury will automatically add the required toggle to your avatar during the upload process. No manual adjustments needed!

### Usage Notes

- **Processing Time:** 
  - The app may need to process up to 4-5 rounds to accurately determine your lobby's round order.
  - This delay is to help correctly identify whether itâ€™s Terror Nights or not, on non Terror Nights days it should learn the pattern faster! 
  
- **Existing Lobby:** 
  - If youâ€™ve already been in the lobby for a while before launching the app, it should automatically detect the round order without needing to process any new rounds. Just start the app and toggle the sign!

### Running the App

1. **Launch** `TONSign_Classic_or_Special.exe`.
2. **Start some rounds in Terrors of Nowhere.** 
   - The app will handle the rest!

The app also prints out some useful debug info, such as if it detects a host-change. It also shows the types of up to the last 7 rounds.
